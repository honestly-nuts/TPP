# TTP

TTP is a preprocessor that is used to genarate test files. The TTP preprocessor was made for the [Scuffed-Utils Project](https://github.com/honestly-nuts/Scuffed-Utils/) as
a preprocessor that genarates txt files from imput files with specific syntax (More about syntax in the tree/syntax.test file). This preprocessor was made for the devs of our
Project to genarate input files from manual pages (That they or other people wrote) for their programs.

#### Caution: The TTP preprocessor is still in very early development so don't expect any grownd-breaking fetures from it yet.

## Usage

#### First make a file with the .test extension (optional).
#### Then write information about the your program.
#### Then write start
#### Then write the text your program will use
#### Then write end
#### Then write the expected outcome
